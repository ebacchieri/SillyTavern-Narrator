# SillyTavern Narrator

## Overview

A [SillyTavern](https://docs.sillytavern.app/) extension that acts as a dynamic Dungeon Master or Narrator's assistant. It uses a configured LLM to generate a list of creative, narrative actions that can happen next in your story, helping you overcome writer's block and drive the plot forward in interesting ways.

Instead of just generating lore, this extension provides a set of six distinct, paragraph-long scenarios suitable for a 1d6 dice roll, giving you a range of creative options to choose from.

## Features

-   **Dynamic Story Suggestions**: Generates 6 detailed narrative actions based on the current chat context and your prompt.
-   **Narrator/DM Perspective**: The AI acts as a third-person narrator, proposing events and scenarios that involve the characters, the environment, and the wider world.
-   **Interactive UI**: Each suggestion comes with a set of controls:
    -   **Publish**: Sends the action directly to the chat as a narrator message and closes the popup.
    -   **Revise**: Send instructions to the AI to modify a specific suggestion.
    -   **Copy**: Copies the action's text to your clipboard.
    -   **Dismiss**: Removes the suggestion from the list.
-   **Easy Access**: Open the Narrator UI from two places:
    -   The main extensions menu (click the Wand icon ðŸª„, then "Narrator").
-   **Highly Configurable**: Almost every aspect of the AI's behavior can be configured, including:
    -   The system prompts that define the Narrator's role and output format.
    -   The context sent to the AI (chat history, character cards, etc.).
    -   The connection profile and generation settings to use.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Narrator UI**:
    -   Click the **Wand icon (ðŸª„)** in the top menu bar, then click **Narrator** from the extensions list.
    -   Alternatively, type `/narrator` into the chat input and press Enter.
2.  **Configure Settings**: In the left-hand panel, select the AI connection profile you want to use and choose what context (chat history, character details, etc.) should be sent.
3.  **Write a Prompt**: In the "Your Prompt" section, tell the Narrator what you want ideas for (e.g., *"What happens when we enter the spooky castle?"*).
4.  **Generate Suggestions**: Click the **Send Prompt** button.
5.  **Interact with Actions**: The right-hand panel will populate with six narrative suggestions. Use the **Publish**, **Revise**, **Copy**, or **Dismiss** buttons on each suggestion to continue your story.

## Configuration

This extension is designed to be highly flexible. You can customize the core prompts that guide the AI by going to the main SillyTavern settings, navigating to the **Extensions** tab, and finding the **Narrator** section. Here, you can edit the templates for the Narrator's role, the XML format rules, and more to tailor the generated results to your specific needs.

## Acknowledgements

This extension is heavily inspired by and is a significant rework of the [SillyTavern-WorldInfo-Recommender](https://github.com/bmen25124/SillyTavern-WorldInfo-Recommender) by bmen25124. Many of the core ideas and initial code structure were adapted from that project.
